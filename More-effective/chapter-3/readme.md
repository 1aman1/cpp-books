## Part 3: Conversions

### âœ… Item 11: Handle assignment in base classes

- Assignment operators must handle derived classes carefully.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Let derived classes handle their own members after the base class assignment.

---

### âœ… Item 12: Understand the costs of conversions

- Costly implicit conversions can lead to performance degradation.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Prefer explicit conversions where non-trivial work is involved.

---

### âœ… Item 13: Make conversion operators explicit

- Avoid surprising implicit conversions.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Prefer `explicit operator Type()` in modern C++.

---

### âœ… Item 14: Be wary of user-defined conversion functions

- Overusing conversion operators can lead to confusing code.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Limit conversion functions to only whatâ€™s necessary.
