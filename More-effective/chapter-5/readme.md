## Part 5: Implementations

### âœ… Item 19: Treat class design as type design

- Consider copyability, comparability, streamability, etc.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Be thorough when designing new types.

---

### âœ… Item 20: Avoid data members that are pointers to implementation details

- Prefer value semantics when possible.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Don't expose raw pointers if you can help it.

---

### âœ… Item 21: Use double-checked locking cautiously

- Improper use is prone to race conditions.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Prefer C++11 constructs (`std::call_once`) to ensure thread-safe initialization.

---

### âœ… Item 22: Beware of compiler optimizations

- Optimizations can break poorly designed code that relies on undefined behavior.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Write correct code first; optimize only when needed.

---

### âœ… Item 23: Understand the cost of non-virtual interface classes (NVI)

- Forces calling through a stable public interface.

ðŸ§  **Tip**: Use NVI to decouple public APIs from customizable behavior.
